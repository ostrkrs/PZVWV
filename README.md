## Main information
Additions:
1. JS-2100, an extended version of JS-2000;
2. JS-1' semi-auto shotgun series! A standard JS-1000 and an extended JS-1100. JS-1000 can be sawn off.

Mechanic and balance tweaks:
1. Decreased delay between shots of the double-barreled shotgun;
2. Slightly degreased reloading speed of the double-barreled shotgun;
3. Made recoil pads and ammo straps attachable to the sawed-off double barrel shotgun;
4. JS-2000 and sawed-off JS-2000's ammo capacity reduced to 4+1.

Known issues:
1. Recoil pads attached to the sawn-off double barrel shotgun appears to be invisible;
2. Sawing JS-1000's barrel off destroys attached weapon modifications.
